# bookmark-manager

First User Story
As a user 
I want to see a list of bookmarks
So that I can access my favourite website easily


![Domain Model for Bookmark challenge](https://github.com/tatiananantes/bookmark-manager/blob/main/images/domain_model.png)


Setting up the bookmarks database:
1. Connect to psql
2. Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
3. Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
4. Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
